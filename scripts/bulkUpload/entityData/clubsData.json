We continue to exist on stolen land from murdered indigenous peoples, and we continue the theft along with the murder. Canada went on to suppress other minorities (any list would oversimplify) much of which continues today. This reality necessitates that we study the topic, review our history, to attempt understand today, and to prepare for tomorrow. As Heschel said “We are not all guilty, but we are all responsible.” In this contemporary review, we hope to better comprehend the past and the present from our current standpoint. The topics are broad and can only be understood with serious analysis of its different embodiments. It is possible that, given the constantly changing abuses, a study of genocides and political violence will never be complete. As such, we nonetheless hope to make a small contribution to a global exchange.",

As a McGill affiliate all students and faculty at McGill can use its library free of charge.",

In recognition of the intersection of Queerness and other marginalized identities, Queer McGill allies itself with organizations supporting marginalized and oppressed Groups and supports their political actions and causes.",

The Daily currently produces one print issue every week, online content, as well as Unfit to Print, its podcast produced in collaboration with CKUT. Le Délit was introduced in 1977. It was first limited to a French section of the regular McGill Daily, then grew to be its own weekly French issue (then called Le McGill Daily Français) before separating itself from The Daily in 1979, becoming its sister newspaper.

        "description": "The Cube is the largest student-run 3D-printing service at McGill University. It's main lab space is located on the second floor of the MacDonald Engineering Building, room MD264 (just down the hall from Mechanical Engineering Reception). There are currently five 3D printers in the lab, and 2 3D scanners, servicing clients including students, professors, and even the general public can submit 3D printing orders to The Cube via their online ordering system found on their website. A student technician uses 3D printing software to evaluate the submitted designs and then sends an quote to the customer. Once the price of the quote has been confirmed by the customer, the technician will put the print on the printer. When the print is complete, the customer can pay for and pick up their completed print at CopiEUS. The typical lead time of a print ranges from 2 days to 1 week.",
