  Youth Outreach Program (YOP)â€™s goal is to reach out to youth at risk and develop positive relationships while emphasizing soft literacy skills such as creativity, communication, and self-expression. As a member, you will get to plan activities for your group, develop personal relationships with the youth and the other volunteers, and most of all, be a MENTOR. We use a mailing list in order to keep in touch with our members and those interested in joining our group.
