description: |
  K-Rave is a club that aims to engage members in K-pop and Korean entertainment culture through events, performances, and more! Our club consists of two sides: the performance team and regular K-Rave events. Our performance team works on covers, performances, workshops, and a year-end showcase every March. We recruit new performers in the Fall semesters and we encourage you to audition! We also have non-performance events that consist of casual hangouts, picnics, game nights, and more. No performance skills required, they are meant for everyone to enjoy!
