description: |
  McGill Students for Wildlife Conservation aims to create events, fundraising, and volunteer opportunities that provide McGill students with hands-on experience in local conservation efforts. It places an emphasis on localized conservation techniques to secure the future of healthy ecosystems. This involves working hand-in-hand with human lives that shape natural environments to create a thriving community for all plants and animals within these ecosystems. Canada has a unique set of environmental issues in the face of the unprecedented climate crisis; including arctic warming, marine and freshwater pollution, and threats to biodiversity. Our club has the opportunity to mobilize students to engage with our local urban ecology that serves our downtown campus. With this, McGill Students for Wildlife Conservation has a mandate to protect and conserve habitats and populations of the worldâ€™s vulnerable species, placing an emphasis on rectifying threats to our local environment.
