description: |
  Montreal is a city full of diversity, made of people from all over the world like refugees and migrants. We aim to provide a sustainable structure of integration for refugees and migrants in McGill as well as to offer support for students and their families by creating frameworks for socializing and building a community within McGill as well as the wider Montreal community. We also aim to promote the education of the student body and the public on refugee and migrant issues and ways to productively support and advocate for refugees and migrants.
