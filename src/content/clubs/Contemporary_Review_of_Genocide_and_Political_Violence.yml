name: "Contemporary Review of Genocide and Political Violence"
description: |
  Canada is no stranger to genocide, although Canadians sometimes can be. We are a nation founded on genocide. We continue to exist on stolen land from murdered indigenous peoples, and we continue the theft along with the murder. Canada went on to suppress other minorities (any list would oversimplify) much of which continues today. This reality necessitates that we study the topic, review our history, to attempt understand today, and to prepare for tomorrow. As Heschel said “We are not all guilty, but we are all responsible.” In this contemporary review, we hope to better comprehend the past and the present from our current standpoint. The topics are broad and can only be understood with serious analysis of its different embodiments. It is possible that, given the constantly changing abuses, a study of genocides and political violence will never be complete. As such, we nonetheless hope to make a small contribution to a global exchange.
