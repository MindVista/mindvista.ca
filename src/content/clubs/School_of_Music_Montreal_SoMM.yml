  The School of Music Montreal (SoMM)â€™s mission is to promote music education equality to underserved youth in Montreal and across Canada. At SoMM McGill, this primarily means providing free music lessons for students at English-speaking Montreal elementary schools that would otherwise have limited access to music education. McGill students can volunteer as teachers, who help a student learn to play their instrument, or with one of our logistics teams, which assist in event planning, fundraising, finances, administration, and other SoMM operations. You do not have to be a formally trained musician to teach, and speaking French is not required. Fall 2022 will be our 15th semester to offer music lessons, and we hope that you can join us!! Feel free to reach out by email or visit our website if you have any questions or want to be a member of the SoMM team.
