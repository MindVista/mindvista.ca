name: "Multi-Ethnic Student Alliance"
description: |
  We are a group of multi-ethnic students exploring our identity through events, food, music, and friendly discussions! If you have to pull out a family tree when people ask where you’re from, had trouble filling out the Census, or have never really thought about your cultural identity before – you’ve come to the right place. Besides celebrating our diverse backgrounds, we are also here to be a safe space where everyone can feel comfortable being their unique selves.
