  Synesthesia (formerly known as SynesthASIA) is a fashion for charity club based in Montreal and is inspired by its namesake – the neurological blending of cross-wired senses. In this regard, Synesthesia’s biggest fundraiser of the year, the Charity Fashion Show, stimulates the senses in a blend of charity, fashion, art, and music. Synesthesia sets itself apart from other philanthropic initiatives at McGill with its unique cosmopolitan approach and dedication to excellence in fashion. Montreal’s up-and-coming multicultural creative scene inspires Synesthesia’s artistic vision. We aim to celebrate fashion by admiring the work of dedicated local designers that we feature in our annual Charity Fashion Show. Since its inception, Synesthesia has raised for $50,000 for multiple charities.
