name: "Music Education Undergraduate Student Association (MEdUSA)"
description: |
  The Music Education Undergraduate Students' Association exists to provide services to strengthen the educational, cultural, environmental, political and social conditions of our membership, as well as to facilitate interaction between members and professionals in the field of Music Education. MEdUSA represents all of the students in the â€‹Concurrent B.Mus/B.Ed program, the Advanced Placement B.Ed in Music program, and all Minor in Music Education students. The council, consisting of six executive and three representative positions, promotes the welfare of their student population by providing solutions for course selection and scheduling conflicts, organizing annual social events, and providing fun and educational workshops, some of which are mentored by members of the QBA (Quebec Band Association). MEdUSA also helps students create a circle of contacts with current band teachers in the Montreal region, recently graduated McGill students, and current staff and peers at McGill. We also work to make current and recently graduated students aware of job opportunities in the area. MEdUSA works hard in order for students in music education to have the best experience while studying at McGill University.
