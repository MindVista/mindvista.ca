  The McGill Mafia Club is a social club open to anyone who wants to play or learn how to play the game “Mafia,” also known as Werewolf. Mafia is a social psychology game that pits the uninformed majority (villagers) against an informed minority (mafia). Villagers must guess who the mafia are among them while attempting to avoid being killed themselves. In addition to playing mafia, we also play other related intrigue games such as One Night Werewolf, Two Rooms and a Boom, and The Resistance for example. There are usually snacks to go around during the meetings. Outside of our regularly scheduled gatherings, we host multiple social events a year like parties, picnics, ice skating, and trivia nights to name a few. We’re open to anyone who would like to join. Come for a meeting and try it out!
