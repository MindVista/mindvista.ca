description: |
  Beginner knitter or an expert at crochet ? Either way, McGill Students for Knitting Club is a relaxing space for knitters, crocheters and anyone interested in fibre arts to gather and explore the craft together! Club activities aim to be as stress/pressure free as possible, with weekly meetings that allow members to get together, chat and unwind from the daily grind while making progress to whatever project they happen to be working on at the moment. Attendance is not mandatory in the slightest, and members are free to attend every meeting or just one throughout the course of the semester. In addition to weekly meetings, the club also holds occasional beginner’s workshops for both knitting and crochet to teach members the basics so they have the tools to get started on their exploration of the world of fibre arts! So no experience is required at all – feel free to contact us if you have any questions!
