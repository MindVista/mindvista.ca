  The International Management Association is a platform where the students, faculty and alumni of the Major in International Management Program can meet and interact with one another. We aim to provide networking opportunities and self-developing resources as well to create a stronger student body for both International Management students and those passionate about the field of international business. We will also serve as a bridge between students and the faculty, representing the studentsâ€™ perspectives in various issues in order to help shape the future of the program.
