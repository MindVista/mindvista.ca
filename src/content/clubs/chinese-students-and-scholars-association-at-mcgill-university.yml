  CSSA aims to provide Chinese students overseas with useful assistance to help them quickly adapt to the new learning and the living environment, as well as organize a variety of amazing events to enhance their overall experience both on and off-campus. Visioning itself as a progressive student community, not only does CSSA seek to increase recognition within the university, but also to amplify broader influence through actively undertaking its social responsibilities. In order to attain this long-term objective, CSSA is devoted to bridging its members with multiple well-known enterprises, NPOs, and local businesses. Nonetheless, as an inheritor of Chinese culture, CSSA is committed to make the world aware of the richness and uniqueness of the thriving Chinese cultural heritage and innovation by fostering better cultural connection, interaction, and exchange with students from other countries.
