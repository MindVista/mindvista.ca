  McGill Students for The Open Door Montréal (MSTODM) acts as a liaison between McGill students and The Open Door Montréal shelter. The Open Door is a non-profit organization located minutes from campus which provides shelter, food, and amenities for those who are under-housed in Montreal. The organization relies heavily on volunteer support to operate. Through MTSODM, students have the opportunity to volunteer at The Open Door in a variety of roles: in the kitchen preparing and serving meals, in the cloakroom sorting clothing donations, or receiving visitors to the shelter at the front desk. MTSODM provides extensive training and support to all student volunteers at The Open Door. The community at The Open Door benefits greatly from student volunteers, and students in turn will have the opportunity to be involved in their local community.
