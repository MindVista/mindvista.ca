  The McGill Hellenic Student Associationâ€™s mission is to promote Hellenic culture by holding events which unify students of Hellenic descent, and those simply interested in our culture. By promoting an open atmosphere and propagating Hellenic culture, both ancient and modern, we intend to bring the true spirit of Neo-Hellenism to life amongst the members of our organization. Fuelled by a strong Greek spirit, we also hope to create and maintain a sense of community that will always strive to achieve excellence and is a great joy to participate in.
