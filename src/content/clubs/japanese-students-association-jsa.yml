name: "Japanese Students Association (JSA)"
description: |
  We are a student association based at McGill University that intends to:
   
   1. Raise awareness of traditional and modern Japanese culture.
   2. Create opportunities for both Japanese and non-Japanese students to practice and learn the language.
   3. Aid students in finding opportunities to work or intern at Japanese companies or global companies based in Japan.
   Raise funds for charities in Japan that support the well-being of the country e.g. the Tohoku relief.
   4. Provide students with opportunities for socializing and involvement, through social events and volunteering, from which friendships and community are built.
   5. Create a local Japanese community and Japanese Alumni network for the purpose of sharing information and resources.
   
   We are a very diverse group of students and although some of our members are indeed Japanese, there are many non-Japanese members as well. Even though we have varying backgrounds, we all have a common interest in Japanese culture and language.
