description: |
  Girls for Ghana is a student-run club with the main goal of fundraising on behalf of the Create Change Foundation. The Create Change Foundation is a registered Canadian non-profit that focuses on empowering girls in Ghana through education and leadership, allowing them to help their families and communities out of poverty. Their mission is to lead a self-sufficient model of charity that is run by empowered youth. We host various fundraisers throughout the year, as well as guest speaker panels and social events. This club is a safe space for all McGill students to learn more about the importance of womenâ€™s education, gain leadership experience, and help grant others the same opportunities that we are so privileged to have.
