  Are you yearning explore National Parks inside and out of Montreal? Do you want to learn more about the history of Quebec and Canada? Are you passionate about wildlife conservation? Do you want to meet people who also love the outdoors? McGill Parks Canada Campus Club is a student-lead group that explores the National Parks and National Historic Sites the greater Quebec region has to offer! Our trips, events, and meetings focus on exploring outdoor and public spaces, conservation, and cultural excursions. We typically host weekend camping trips outside of Montreal each semester, as well as shorter day trips and meetings throughout the semester. If you have any questions or want to get involved, email us at mcgillcampusclub@gmail.com. Weâ€™d love to have you join us!
