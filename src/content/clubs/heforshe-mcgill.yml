  HeForShe McGill is an SSMU club dedicated to raising awareness on campus about the importance of involving male-identifying and majority-gendered individuals in the movement for gender equality, and about gender issues, their causes, and their consequences on people of all genders. We seek to create a forum for discussion for those of all gender identities interested in gender issues, and encourage those who typically feel alienated from the movement to be a part of it, through interactive movie screenings, fundraisers, discussions, and educational events.
