  The SSMU Powerlifting Club is a student society at McGill dedicated to strength training. Our club caters both to competitive athletes, those who are looking to learn or progress in a new sport as well as those who enjoy lifting weights at the gym to get fit and stronger! Our goals as a club are to build a social community of people who share a passion in lifting heavy weights, setting goals at the gym and of course, eating a lot of food. We offer our members a chance to make new friends and have a good time at the gym while reaching their goals.
