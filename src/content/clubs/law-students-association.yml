name: "Law Students' Association"
description: |
  The Law Students' Association was created on March 12, 1912. Before that time, law students were members exclusively of the Student Society of McGill University (SSMU). Since then, our membership has grown from 30 to about 600. On May 4, 1992 the LSA was incorporated and continues to play a very active role in student life and student governance at various levels: Faculty, University, Provincial, and Federal. The LSA is the official student organization of the Faculty of Law of McGill University. We aim at representing your voice in the Faculty's administration as well as offering services, organizing events and supporting your projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please come and see us in the LSA office in the basement of Old Chancellor Day Hall, write us an email, call us, or simply stop us in the halls. The LSA executive has 9 members who represent law students. Every executive member is elected or acclaimed during end-of-year elections.
