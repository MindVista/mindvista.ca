description: |
  The McGill Thaqalayn Muslim Students’ Association (TMA) grew out of a desire to provide a space for Muslim students, especially those who identify as Shi’i, to practice their faith and rediscover their values.
   
   While we primarily are here to provide a space for Muslims, we are open to Muslims and non-Muslims of all backgrounds.
