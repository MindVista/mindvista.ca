name: "Comparative Healthcare Systems Program (CHSP)"
description: |
  The Comparative Healthcare Systems Program (CHSP) is a public & global health based student group at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Through various initiatives, like conferences, lectures and international exchange programs, we provide opportunities for students to get engaged in the study of public health and comparative healthcare. We believe that our hands-on approach to healthcare systems allows for the best understanding of how they work, and can pave the way for meaningful and substantive improvement.
