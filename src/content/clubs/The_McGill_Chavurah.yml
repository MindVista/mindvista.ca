  The McGill Chavurah is a community intent on creating inclusive spaces for Jewish students. We host regular shabbat services and other events in the McGill neighbourhood which aim to integrate the peace and comfort of shared jewish experience into the hectic feeling of student life. We are progressive, sustainable, inclusive, traditional, non-hierarchical, and egalitarian in both structure and practice. Because we are student-run, we evolve to fit the needs of our changing community every year. We prioritize your input and support, and dedicate this project to you, McGillâ€™s Jews.
