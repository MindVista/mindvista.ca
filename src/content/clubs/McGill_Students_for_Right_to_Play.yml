name: "McGill Students for Right to Play"
description: |
  We are the official university representatives of Right To Play at McGill University. The role of the student ambassadors is to raise awareness and to organize fundraising events in support of Right To Play. Specifically, McGill Students for Right To Play works within the student community to fundraise and spread awareness of the foundation. In the Fall of 2006, a few students shared Right To Playâ€™s belief in harnessing the power of sport for development and peace around the world and since becoming established we have developed into a successful and popular club at McGill. We plan athletic as well as social events in order to raise money for the international Right To Play organization and to expose the McGill community to a worthy cause. Not only are we aiming to raise more funds for Right To Play, but we are also striving to create a greater sense of awareness for the organization at McGill and strengthen our network by expanding into the Montreal community.
