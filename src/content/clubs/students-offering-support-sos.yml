name: "Students Offering Support (SOS)"
description: |
  Students Offering Support (SOS) is a national student-led charity made up of a network of student volunteers working through university chapters to coordinate and teach Exam-AIDâ€™s (group review sessions prior to midterms/finals for first and second year courses). SOS charges a $20 donation for students to attend our sessions and at the end of each year, all the money raised by an SOS chapter is spent on an educational sustainable development project in a Latin American country. These projects are not only funded by SOS, but they are also planned and built by SOS volunteers through an annual outreach trip. This full-circle experience provides volunteers an experience to see the direct impact they can have on their community as well as in marginalized communities around the world.
