description: |
  McGill Swing Kids (MSK) is a student-organized club that works to provide affordable swing-style dance lessons (such as Lindy Hop, Charleston, Jazz, Balboa – and everything in between!). Although the majority of our members are students, we welcome dancers of all ages and skill levels. We aim to share our passion for Swing by providing a fun, friendly, and lively approach to swing dancing. We also aim to provide a launchpad to the greater swing community in Montreal. Let us teach you all you need to swing like a jitterbug, join us for outings at the most swinging venues in town, and ask us for tips or school recommendations: that’s what we’re here for!
