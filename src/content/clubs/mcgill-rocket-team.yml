name: "McGill Rocket Team"
description: |
  The McGill Rocket Team is an EUS Design Team that aims to develop a Canadian aerospace community by providing students with practical experience in the development of rocket technologies and by promoting the Canadian aerospace industry. In practice, this means that members of the team build sounding rockets for various student rocketry competitions. The main competition the Rocket Team participated had been the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC), now called Spaceport America Cup (SAC), but as of 2022, the McGill Rocket Team is planning to compete in the Launch Canada competition. The team, founded in 2014, has grown from 20 members to roughly 150 members, and is among the biggest design teams at McGill University.
