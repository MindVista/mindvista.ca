name: "Effusion A Cappella"
description: |
  We’re McGill’s premier a cappella ensemble! Formed over 20 years ago, Effusion started off a small and humble group of musicians who laid a foundation of soul haunting repertoire and mind-numbing good looks for future generations to build on. 20 years, 3 CDs, and countless road-trips and weekend retreats later, Effusion is still laughing, good-time-ing, and making sweet sweet a cappella. Effusion performs at events, soirees, dinners, festivals, and student functions in and around Montreal, QC. The group has competed in many renowned competitions such as the International Competitions of Collegiate A Cappella and the Montreal Chinese Community and Cultural Center’s Making the Band ’09, in which we placed 2nd in the ’09 Northeast division and first overall. Music sans instruments is our passion, and we draw our influences from across the musical spectrum. R&B, soul, gospel, pop, folk, rock, and jazz influences can all be heard in our repertoire.
