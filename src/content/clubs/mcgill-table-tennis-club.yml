  The McGill Table Tennis Club aims to increase exposure for the sport of table tennis in the McGill community as well as foster a friendly, yet competitive environment for players of all skill levels to improve at the sport. We host practice sessions once a week where you can drop-in whenever you have time and either play with friends or seek guidance from one of our practice coordinators who can help you improve.
