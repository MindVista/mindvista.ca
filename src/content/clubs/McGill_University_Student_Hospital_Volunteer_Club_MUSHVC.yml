name: "McGill University Student Hospital Volunteer Club (MUSHVC)"
description: |
  We are a group of students who have been volunteering at McGill affiliated hospitals (and now more!) that are trying to give the same experiences to incoming and current McGill students. We coordinate with hospitals to get student applications in, host volunteer appreciation events/socials and run fundraisers to donate money to the volunteering programs run at the hospitals! All of this and hands-on hospital experience we offer to McGill Students!
