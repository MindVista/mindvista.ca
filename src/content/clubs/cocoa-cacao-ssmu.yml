  We are McGill’s one and only chocolate club ‚ a group of chocolate lovers dedicated to bringing joy in the form of chocolate to our student body. We host chocolate-themed events throughout the academic year, such as our annual Cacao70 Factory Tour, our Homemade Truffle Sale for Valentine’s Day, and our Make-Your-Own Hot Chocolate Bar. This year (2020-2021) we will have virtual and distanced events such as online baking tutorials and delivered homemade care packages.
