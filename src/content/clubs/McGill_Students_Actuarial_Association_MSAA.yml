description: |
  The McGill Students’ Actuarial Association is a nascent SSMU student club looking to boost support for aspiring actuaries at McGill. We serve as a liaison between actuarial students and their goals, providing members with information on actuarial science to allow them to break into the actuarial world. We provide a place where students with similar interests can connect with one another and be represented for by a student association.
