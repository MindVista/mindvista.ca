description: |
  The Co-Op Mining Engineering Undergraduate Society, or CMEUS, is a department in the EUS. The CMEUS is the undergraduate society for all mining students, regardless of whether or not they have elected to maintain their co-op degree status. The CMEUS is responsible for organizing several events and fun opportunities for involvement throughout each academic year. The mining student council organizes both new events and events that have been successful. These events vary greatly in nature from a active full-day ice fishing trip, to a relaxing games night in collaboration with another departmental council. Certain initiatives such as industry speaker talks at McGill University and the organization of an annual trip to The Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) Conference in Toronto offer mining engineering students at McGill diverse opportunities to gain insight on interesting topics and additionally network with industry professionals.
