description: |
  The McGill Students’ Cancer Society (MSCS) is a student-led group dedicated to making a difference in the lives of Canadians affected by cancer. By organizing fundraising campaigns, raising awareness, and of course planning our annual Relay For Life, the MSCS contributes to funding life-saving cancer research and patient support programs provided by the Canadian Cancer Society. A cancer diagnosis can change everything, but then again, so can you.
