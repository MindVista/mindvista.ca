name: "Daily Publications Society – The McGill Daily & Le Délit"
description: |
  The Daily Publications Society (DPS) is a fully independent, student-run, not-for-profit organisation which publishes two student newspapers at McGill University : The McGill Daily and Le Délit. The McGill Daily began as a daily sports rag in 1911 and has served the McGill community ever since, evolving into its current format as an alternative media outlet. The Daily currently produces one print issue every week, online content, as well as Unfit to Print, its podcast produced in collaboration with CKUT. Le Délit was introduced in 1977. It was first limited to a French section of the regular McGill Daily, then grew to be its own weekly French issue (then called Le McGill Daily Français) before separating itself from The Daily in 1979, becoming its sister newspaper. Want to get involved with our papers ? The McGill Daily and Le Délit are always looking for new writers and contributors to join their team! As a student at McGill you are already a member of the DPS and have a say in how our papers are run. No experience is necessary.
