name: "Inertia Modern Dance Collective"
description: |
  Inertia Modern Dance Collective is founded on the assertion that contemporary dance is a constantly evolving art form. Participating in rehearsals and workshops, members of the company seek to contribute to the expansion of this medium through experimentation with movement and choreographic development. We believe that the creative process is just as important as the final product â€“ our annual holiday and spring dance performances. Ideas, discussion, talented dancers and fundraising are what keep our collective strong!
