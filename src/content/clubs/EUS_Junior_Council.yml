name: "EUS Junior Council"
description: |
  Junior Council is a committee under the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS), composed of approximately twenty-one first year engineering students, with two second year co-presidents. At the beginning of the fall semester, all incoming first years are encouraged to apply for any VP positions, departmental representatives, or external council representatives. The councilâ€™s goal is to welcome all first year engineering students by organizing both academic and social events throughout the school year, and to create a strong network of first year students. :)
