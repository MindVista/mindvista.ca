  McGill Students for Make-a-Wish is a chapter of the Make A Wish Foundation located at McGill University. Throughout the year, we organize various events, both social and athletic to raise funds for Make-A-Wish Quebec. Our mission is to adopt one childâ€™s wish every year as well as to raise awareness to the student body about this great cause. Last year we met this goal.
