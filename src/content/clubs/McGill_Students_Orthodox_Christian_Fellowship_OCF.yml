  Orthodox Christian Fellowship (OCF) is the official collegiate campus ministry program under SCOBA (the Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas). Our mission is to support fellowships on college campuses, whose members experience and witness to the Orthodox Christian Church through community life, prayer, service to others and study of the Faith. Join us for bi-weekly discussions and Bible studies and hangouts as well as other special events including retreats, monastery visits, and fellowship events! When not meeting in person, join us on our Zoom calls! All are welcome! Email us to join our Listserv and to stay updated on our events and gatherings!
