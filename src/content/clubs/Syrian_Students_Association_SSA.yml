  Welcome to the Syrian Studentsâ€™ Association of McGill University! We are a non-profit student club under SSMU. We are a secular, apolitical club that is not affiliated with nor subsidized by any political party or religious group. Our events are open to everyone! ðŸ™‚
   
   Our clubâ€™s mission can be summarized in 4 main articles:
   1. Social mission: assist newly settled Syrians in Montreal by helping them with social integration and navigating available resources, from applying to University or finding language classes.
   2. Humanitarian mission: support Syrian refugees, both locally and abroad, through supporting organizations that provide humanitarian relief and raising awareness on McGill campus about the Syrian refugee crisis and conflict.
   3. Educational mission: empower Syrian youth by supporting organizations that offer educational resources.
   4. Cultural mission: bring the Syrian community in Montreal together by holding cultural and social events.
