  Heal and Hope is a recently founded club that works to host and coordinate events to simultaneously raise awareness about the overlooked cases of children with war-related injuries and fundraise for reconstructive surgeries that they require. Further, we aim to connect McGill students to volunteering opportunities through Children of Water foundationâ€™s global reach mission.
