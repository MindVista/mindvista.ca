name: "McGill Ultimate Club"
description: |
  The McGill Ultimate Club consists of four ultimate teams affiliated with McGill University: Men’s A and B, and Women’s A and B. Our A teams are highly competitive and consistently place top 5 at the Canadian University Ultimate Championships. The B teams are more developmental and are composed of players with less experience or those who would prefer a less competitive atmosphere. All members become part of a tight-knit community that hosts several events throughout the year, including an end-of-season banquet that recognizes the hard work and achievement of our members.
