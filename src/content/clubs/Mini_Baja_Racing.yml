  McGill Baja has a proud history full of hard work, friendship, ingenuity and sweat. From sleepless nights to Jacquelinâ€™s Sugar Shack Challenge, we have experienced it all over the years. In the 2020-21 season, the Baja Racing Team will to compete in Kentucky, Quebec City, Peoria, and Kentucky (again!). Midnight Mayhem in Kentucky and Epreuve du Nord in Quebec City are the "friendly" competitions where we get to bring our old vehicles and as many new members as we can for a couple days of fun.
