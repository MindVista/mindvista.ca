description: |
  AOSSUM (Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Society of Undergraduates at McGill) is the officially recognized council representing the atmospheric and oceanic science (AOS) undergraduates. It is involved in helping undergrads in academic issues, addressing problems, organizing events, and promotion of the AOS department.
  
  The diverse blend of courses in AOS explore many topics throughout the study of weather and climate. Whether youâ€™re interested in waves and fluid dynamics, the connection between the air and ocean, or the kind of weather that turns wild and destructive, the spectrum is vast and each professor you meet has spent their lives looking into specific areas of the atmosphere.
