description: |
  McGill Robotics is an engineering design team that builds robots for international competitions as well as organizes a robotics themed hackathon annually. The team’s goal is to foster an interest in robotics through competition, cultivate a relationship with the surrounding Montreal community, and much closer to home, to create a core community at McGill. We prioritize team bonding and growth along with engineering accomplishment, with the belief that it takes a solid team to build a winning robot. McGill Robotics currently fosters four technical projects – AUV, Drone, Mars Rover, RoboHacks – and one Business Team, who oversees team Finances, Sponsorship, Marketing and Outreach Events.
