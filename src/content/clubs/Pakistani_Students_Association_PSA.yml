  For more than thirty years, the Pakistani Studentsâ€™ Association has committed itself to bringing the vitality and vibrancy of Pakistani life to the McGill community. Today, the organization is still fundamentally dedicated to three main objectives:
   
   1. Educating the McGill community about what Pakistan, its culture, and its people have to offer to the greater world.
   2. Establishing a forum to discuss political and social issues that directly involve Pakistan.
   3. Creating a social fabric to connect students of all majors and interests through the experience and celebration of Pakistani culture.
