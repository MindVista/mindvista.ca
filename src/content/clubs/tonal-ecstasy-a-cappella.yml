name: "Tonal Ecstasy A Cappella"
description: |
  Tonal Ecstasy A Cappella is a fixture of the McGill and Montreal music scene. Founded in 1998 by a group of friends who loved to sing, TX has evolved and grown over the past two decades, and now performs not only at their biannual concerts, but also at various professional and personal events around Montreal. Composed of students in almost every faculty at McGill, Tonal Ecstasy’s members are incredibly talented when they perform individually, however, when they come together to perform as a group, their bond and collective love of music shines through their music. More than just being a joy to listen to, a TX performance is vibrant and energetic, and as much fun to watch. Although TX’s alumni are scattered around the world, they remain committed to and involved with the group. Whether they are creating arrangements for TX to perform, or travelling across the country for TX’s 20th anniversary (where over 40 alumni were present!), the alumni play a major role in helping TX be McGill’s greatest a cappella group.
