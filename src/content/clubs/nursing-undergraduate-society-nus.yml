name: "Nursing Undergraduate Society (NUS)"
description: |
  The Nursing Undergraduate Society is the student-run representation of McGillâ€™s Ingram School of Nursing.
  Our primary mandate is to act as a liaison between the staff and students, and also provide a means of contact with other organizations and groups on campus, in addition to promoting communication with professional nursing groups throughout Canada.
  
  We take care of organizing all extracurricular activities for Nursing students (i.e. Frosh, Nursing-Engineering parties, Nursing Auctions, CNSA, Nursing Games, Nursing Apparel sales) in addition to our academic role. In order for the NUS to better reach our students, class representatives are elected from every class according to program and year. Their role is to announce events, to promote student participation within these events and to collect suggestions and feedback to inform the council.
