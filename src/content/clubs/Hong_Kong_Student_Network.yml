  The Hong Kong Student Network strives to accommodate new students from all over the world and help them familiarize themselves with McGill and everything that is beautiful about it. We pride ourselves on being a Home Away From Home for everybody, and we whole-heartedly embrace the multiculturalism that Hong Kong is known for. We plan a wide variety of events, from singing competitions to ski trips, to get the student body involved. We hope that everyone who joins HKSN will have an awesome time and meet lots of new people!
