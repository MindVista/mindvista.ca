  Here at the McGill Badminton Club, we strive to create an encouraging atmosphere where members of all levels feel welcome playing together; whether you are looking for a recreational or a competitive environment. We are currently not offering drop-ins for the fall 2022 semester. Instead, we will be hosting a semester-long tournament collaborating with the McGill Intramurals team.
