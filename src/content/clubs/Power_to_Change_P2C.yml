  Power to Change â€“ Students is a Christian student ministry that desires to help students like you take their next step towards Jesus, wherever you are in your faith journey. We want to see every student walking closer to Jesus and experiencing life in him. As a SSMU club at McGill we meet on and off campus throughout the year, and are part of a bigger network of campus groups in Montreal. We continue to connect as a community and grow together through discipleship groups, prayer meetings, outreaches, socials, and weekly fellowship.
