  The Malaysian and Singaporean Students’ Association of McGill (MASSA) aims to celebrate our cultures, connect members of the community, and foster an inclusive environment for all during events.
   
   Historically, our events are themed around local celebrations (e.g., Deepevali and Chinese New Year). We often incorporate activities that remind us of memories back home and try to recreate the same atmosphere of authentic home-cooked local cuisine. We also provide a warm and accessible platform where members can meet and interact whilst keeping in touch with their roots. While we will continue this tradition, this year we plan on hosting networking events to build stronger connections between our members and alumni who come from Malaysia or Singapore.
   
   MASSA continues to be an important avenue for students from our region to turn to when home is literally on the other side of the world. However, we are also open for anyone of any background to join!
