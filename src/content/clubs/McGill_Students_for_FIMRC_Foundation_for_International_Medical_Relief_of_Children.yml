  At FIMRC McGill, we work towards helping local people in need as well as fundraising for trips abroad. Throughout the school year, we take part in many different fundraising events. With the money we raise, we fund projects across countries in need. We also help locally, volunteering at homeless shelters every week. Any McGill student is welcome to join on Fridays as we cook, socialize, and spend time with the less fortunate of Montreal. Come join us at FIMRC McGill!
