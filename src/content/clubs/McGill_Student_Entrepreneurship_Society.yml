description: |
  The McGill Student Entrepreneurship Society is a student-run group dedicated to promoting and celebrating the entrepreneurial spirit in McGill, Montreal, and beyond, through innovative student events and initiatives. With a mission centred around three pillars – Connect, Inspire & Educate – the MSES aims to intervene in the early stages of student/youth entrepreneurship –namely the consideration and planning phases – as the first resource for McGillians and Montrealers to get inspired, share, learn, and discuss entrepreneurship. We bring threefold value: we foster a community of students from all faculties dedicated to excellence and impact, offer unparalleled educational/career opportunities, and inspire by sharing success/alum stories.
