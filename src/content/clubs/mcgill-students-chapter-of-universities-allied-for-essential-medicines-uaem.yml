name: "McGill Students Chapter of Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM)"
description: |
  Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) is a global network of students that fight to make life-saving medicines affordable and accessible for all. Since universities develop many of the medical technologies that end up in the hands of pharmaceutical companies, students have the power to encourage universities to adopt equitable licensing practices. Throughout the years, our student chapter has been working on promoting the adoption of open science practices across our university, promoting world-wide access to essential medicines and vaccines and on advocating for more transparency around clinical trials. We are also very proud to be one of the main UAEM chapters working on the organization-wide Canadian Report Card project.
