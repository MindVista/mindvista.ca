description: |
  The Women’s Health Advocacy Club offers a unique opportunity to discuss and advocate for issues that fall in the intersection between gender and health. We aim to raise awareness, within the McGill community and beyond, about health issues affecting woman-identifying folk through discussion-based events and more. The Women’s Health Advocacy Club runs an annual speaker series as well as bi-monthly consciousness raising groups to discuss sub-topics of our theme: women’s sexual health. Additional fundraising events and other activities are organized in relation to the theme throughout the year.
