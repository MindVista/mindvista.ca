description: |
  MUGS stands for McGill Undergraduate Geography Society.  As a Geography student, be it a Major, Minor, Honours, or Urban Systems student, you are considered a part of our tight knit MUGS community. This means you are invited to all MUGS events and exec meeting, to have your say in any undergraduate-related decision happening in the department. There is also an executive, which consists of students, elected by all MUGS members, who are tasked with many things throughout the year, including planning events, liaising with the department and other departmental groups, keeping the lounge clean and tidy, and more!
