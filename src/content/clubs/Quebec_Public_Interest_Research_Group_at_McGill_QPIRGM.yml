description: |
  The Quebec Public Interest Research Group at McGill is a student-initiated, student-funded, student-run organization that actively works towards social and environmental justice. Through socially-engaged research, popular education, action, advocacy, and our working groups, QPIRG connects McGill students with the greater Montreal community. QPIRG-McGill has an anti-oppressive mandate, meaning that we are opposed to all forms of structural and interpersonal oppression, including but not limited to oppression on the basis of class, gender, race, sexual orientation, and disability. Using a grassroots, solidarity-based model, QPIRG-McGill is committed to supporting and empowering marginalized communities. QPIRG-McGill is opposed to all forms of discrimination on the basis of: class, gender, race, sexual orientation, and disability. We strive to be inclusive and accessible to everyone. Our work is rooted in an anti-oppression analysis and practice. We seek to build campus-community alliances and inspire social change through inclusive and non-hierarchical approaches.
