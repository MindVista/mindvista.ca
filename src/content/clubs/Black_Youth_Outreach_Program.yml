name: "Black Youth Outreach Program"
description: |
  The Black Youth Outreach Program is a club that aims to stimulate interest in programs at McGill among the black youth of Montreal. Our goals include increasing the representation of black students at McGill, encouraging the pursuit of higher education with a focus on black youth and being a resource prospective students can refer to. We also intend to establish connections with other black associations on campus to expand the network of services offered to black students at McGill, and enrich their university experience. As a club, our mandate is to foster an equitable environment for all students at McGill, increase the sense of belonging of black McGill students, introduce local black youth to a variety of fields and careers McGill degrees give access to, and contribute to abolishing barriers black students face in their pursuit of higher education. Our efforts will be directed towards diversifying fields where black populations are typically underrepresented and providing support to young black students while they are navigating the world of academia, whether it be in their current studies or in the process of applying to McGill.
