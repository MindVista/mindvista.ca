  EUS Ski Trip is the hottest event of the year. The trip usually takes place over the 3rd weekend in January. 50+ McGill Engineers hop on a coach bus and travel to Mount Saint Anne for 2 days and 2 nights of gnar skiing, snowboarding and fun party times. The EUS Ski Trip is a great opportunity to shred some pow and chill with new or old friends. The event is always a hit and sells out so make sure you buy your ticket early!
