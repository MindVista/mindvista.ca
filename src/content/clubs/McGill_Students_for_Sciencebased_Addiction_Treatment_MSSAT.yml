  Addiction treatment is seriously outdated – even on campus! McGill Students for Science-based Addiction Treatment (MSSAT) is a student-led initiative dedicated to this continually overlooked issue. We are concerned by the lack of resources on campus, and the unscientific nature of current (outdated) standards in addiction treatment around the globe. We have lots of exciting projects and events planned, and we’re always looking for innovative + compassionate individuals to join the cause! Our priorities include: evidence-based support groups for students with behavioural and substance addictions, and curriculum changes for relevant programs (e.g. medicine, nursing, social work).
