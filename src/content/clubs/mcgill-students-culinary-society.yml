description: |
  Through the smells, the sounds, the displays, the textures and the tastes, we invest all our five senses in creating and appreciating a dish. Cooking, the unique yet the most prevalent form of art, never cease to add elegance to the everyday life. We believe that people should be eating better foods, and the best foods in the world are yet to be discovered. We strive to arouse enthusiasm for cooking and gastronomy among the McGill community, and we provide opportunities for food enthusiasts to display their talents and meet like-minded friends. Our activities include cooking/baking workshops, themed potlucks, outings to restaurants, screening of food documentaries/movies, inventive food sales and more.
