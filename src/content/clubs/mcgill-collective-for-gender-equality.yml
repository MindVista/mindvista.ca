name: "McGill Collective for Gender Equality"
description: |
  The McGill Collective for Gender Equality engages students through advocacy and fundraising. In support of our goal, our organization raises awareness about gender-based global issues such as violence against women and girls, reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS among women and girls, empowerment programs, and achieving gender equality in democratic governance in a time of peace and conflict. We organize events such as panel discussions on human rights and gender equality, film showings, fundraisers, and discussion groups.
