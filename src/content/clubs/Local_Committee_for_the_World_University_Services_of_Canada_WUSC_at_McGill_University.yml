name: "Local Committee for the World University Services of Canada (WUSC) at McGill University"
description: |
  World University Service of Canada (WUSC) is a non-profit international development organization that works to improve education, employment, and empowerment opportunities for youth around the world. Since 1986, McGill and the student-led Local Committee have welcomed more than 59 former refugees through WUSC with 15 scholars still present. Thanks to a twice-annual student levy, we have been able to sponsor a number of scholars and hope to continue in the coming years. We welcome you to explore how WUSC McGill operates on campus as we continue to support youth to youth mentorship through various social and educational events.
