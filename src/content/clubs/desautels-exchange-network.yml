  The DEN (Desautels Exchange Network) is a student-run organization whose mandate is to welcome and fully integrate exchange students into the student body. Through ongoing communication and regular social & cultural gatherings, DEN allows students to feel home away from home. Going on exchange opens a new world of experiences and the DEN is here to ensure a smooth, fun, and easy transition into life in Montreal. DEN also provides students with a link to other international associations in Montreal, such as MESA (McGill Exchange Students Association), IMA (International Management Association), and groups at Concordia and UQAM.
