  The Indian Students Association at McGill is a student-run organization that upholds Indian culture by celebrating various festivals throughout the year. The events are inclusive, unique, and energetic and will always leave you with a plethora of good memories. As the largest South-asian community on campus, the ISA aims to provide its members with a microcosm of rich Indian traditions. We are the bridge for anyone who wishes to get more involved with Indian culture, whether itâ€™s through food, cinema, music or volunteer projects!
