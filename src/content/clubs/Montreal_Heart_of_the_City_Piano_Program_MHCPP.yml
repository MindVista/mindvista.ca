  The Montreal Heart of the City Piano Program (MHCPP) is a chapter of the national organization, founded in Saskatchewan in 1995. Since November 2007, the MHCPP has offered tuition-free piano lessons to at-risk children at English and French inner-city elementary schools in Montreal. Led by a team of dedicated volunteers through the Student Society of McGill University, the Montreal chapter has grown to include a total of four schools.
