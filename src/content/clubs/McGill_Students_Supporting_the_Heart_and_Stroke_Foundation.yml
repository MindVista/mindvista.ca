name: "McGill Students Supporting the Heart and Stroke Foundation"
description: |
  We are a student organization that is dedicated in furthering the goals of the Heart and Stroke Foundation. Through collaboration with the foundation, we advocate healthy living, raise awareness for heart disease, and fundraise for research. Our hope is to educate and engage the McGill student community through events such as cooking workshops, physical activity, and seminars in order to make them more knowledgeable about the importance of a healthy heart. Furthermore, we strive to lead healthy lifestyles ourselves to be able to be role models in our community. We aim to make the foundationâ€™s vision come true: let people live healthy lives free of heart disease and stroke.
