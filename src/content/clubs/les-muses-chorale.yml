  Les Muses Chorale is a women’s choral ensemble affiliated with the Student’s Society of McGill University (SSMU). We began in 2001 as “Simply Sweetly,” a group of talented young women who created a McGill club to express their passion for fun and challenging choral music. Now in our 20th season, Les Muses Chorale is proud to be a vibrant ensemble dedicated to choral excellence.
