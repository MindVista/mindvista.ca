description: |
  We are a SSMU club, focused on bringing food and nutrition to the McGill community in a sustainable way. Through three endeavours, our nutrition workshops, the Good Food Box, and our annual food conference, we aim to engage and encourage the McGill community to take part in sustainable food systems. We run a biweekly pickup for local produce that would have otherwise been thrown away in the University Centre. If you are interested in learning more, please visit our website!
