description: |
  Friends of MSF groups are student societies in various Canadian Universities. Our McGill chapter is an official supporter of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders). Our goals are to increase awareness for MSF, to create fundraising activities, and to encourage aspiring humanitarians to consider working with MSF. We aim to accomplish these goals through guest speaker events, case competitions, and workshops.
