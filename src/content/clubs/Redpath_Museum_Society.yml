  The Redpath Museum Society (RMS) is a student-run organization that works with McGill’s Redpath Museum to provide outreach programs, museum tours, and a variety of events for the McGill community and the general public. RMS members are united by their love of museology, natural history, science, and discovery through activities like Trivia Night, Coffee and Crystals, and Murder Mystery Gala. The RMS also provides students with volunteering opportunities. We welcome anyone with similar passions to join our team of volunteers and help share knowledge with the community – all while building lifelong communication skills and earning diversified co-curricular experiences.
