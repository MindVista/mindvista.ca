  HOSA McGill provides an educational and interactive learning experience for students that are interested in health care professions. We help to provide students with the means to attend a Spring-Leadership Conference in Toronto as well as an International Conference (if student qualifies). The conference allows students to get hands-on experience in the profession they are interested in such as dentistry, laboratory science, forensic medicine, and more.
